Comments:
- The order does not represent timing.
- Some workshops will be repeated more than once, possibly with different teachers.
- All sessions are planned to be self-contained.
- Everything is still tentative.
- Soon we'll run a survey to check for Clojurians' interests and preferred times, and will make this into a schedule.
