| Wrangling sequences like a cowboy with Injest                                                                                               | Note: This workshop covers material that is best understood by reviewing a prior workshop: “The Structure and Interpretation of Transducers” Summary: Injest provides thread macros (e.g. x>>, =>>) that lower the bar to higher performance by letting you compose transducers in the same way as you would with ->>. In this workshop we will introduce you to injest’s three main features: path threads, auto transducification and auto parallelization. Then, we’ll go over some real world examples of transforming (wrangling) data sequences. We’ll spend the remaining time of the workshop in an open session, answering questions and trying things out at the REPL. I might even wear a cowboy hat, in further jest 🤠 | Injest                                            | John Newman       | yes        | 120min | [1730_22_Nov_2021_in_UTC](https://time.is/1730_22_Nov_2021_in_UTC)                                                                    |                  |             |                |

There will be a brief explanation of how these tools work to start but we will spend most of our time exploring together, so it will be helpful to have a Clojure environment set up on your computer already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Hanami                                            | Kira McLean       | yes        | 90min  | [1600_21_Nov_2021_in_UTC/](https://time.is/1600_21_Nov_2021_in_UTC)                                                                   | 2021-10-27 21:00 | David       |                |

| The Devil’s Interop: Invoking Clojure from Python natively with GraalVM, and other such matters as related to Clojure Polyglot Blood Magick | This is a workshop that demonstrates when, why, and how to compile Clojure code into a shared library that can be called natively by CPython (no runtime JVM required!), in the same way that Clojure code can be compiled into a Jar which can be used natively by Java.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | libpython-clj, tech.ml.datatype, GraalVM, CPython | James J.

Comments:

- The ordering does not represent timing.
- Some workshops will be repeated more than once, possibly with different teachers.
- All sessions are planned to be self-contained.
- Everything is still tentative.
- Soon we'll run a survey to check for Clojurians' interests and preferred times, and will make this into a schedule.
- podcast status indicates the state of the recording, e.g., in post, published.
