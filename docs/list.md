| Wrangling sequences like a cowboy with Injest                                                                                               | Summary: Injest provides thread macros (e.g. x>>, =>>) that lower the bar to higher performance by letting you compose transducers in the same way as you would with ->>. In this workshop we will introduce you to injestâ€™s three main features: path threads, auto transducification and auto parallelization. Then, weâ€™ll go over some real world examples of transforming (wrangling) data sequences. Weâ€™ll spend the remaining time of the workshop in an open session, answering questions and trying things out at the REPL. I might even wear a cowboy hat, in further jest ðŸ¤  | Injest                                            | John Newman       | yes        | 120min | [1730_22_Nov_2021_in_UTC](https://time.is/1730_22_Nov_2021_in_UTC)                                                                    |                  |             |                |

Comments:

- The ordering does not represent timing.
- Some workshops will be repeated more than once, possibly with different teachers.
- All sessions are planned to be self-contained.
- Everything is still tentative.
- Soon we'll run a survey to check for Clojurians' interests and preferred times, and will make this into a schedule.
- podcast status indicates the state of the recording, e.g., in post, published.
